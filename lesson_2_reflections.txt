What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

I need to initialize a repository because initializing a repository allows me to begin making commits and start tracking files together.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is different because things can be moved in and out of it without making changes to any existing directory or repository.  This gives some more flexibility in being able to see what changes would make sense to be committed together before actually committing them.
