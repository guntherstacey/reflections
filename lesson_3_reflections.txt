When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

I would want to use a remote repository so that I can share a public form of my project while continuing to work on it locally or if I want to allow other people to contribute to the project without it directly affecting the project I'm working on locally unless I allow it to.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Pulling changes manually means that I have control over when or if remote changes are added to my local repository.  I may not want to add some changes, or I may just not be ready to add them yet.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

A fork is making a copy of a repository from GitHub to GitHub.  A clone is making a copy of a repository from local to local or from GitHub to local.  A branch is one string of commits within a repository.  I would fork if I want to make a copy within GitHub.  I would clone if I want to make a copy within my own computer or from GitHub to my computer.  I would add a new branch if I want to add a commit to my repository that I don't want on the master branch or another already existing branch.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
